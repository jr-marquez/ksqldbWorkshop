## Apache Kafke EOS / Transactional Producer support

Messages can now be produced in a single transaction if `-X transactional.id=..`
is passed to the producer in `-P` mode.

If kafkacat is terminated through Ctrl-C (or other signal) the transaction
will be aborted, while normal termination (due to stdin closing or after reading
all supplied files) will commit the transaction.

```bash
$ kafkacat -b $BROKERS -P -t mytopic -X transactional.id=myproducerapp
% Using transactional producer
This is a transactional message
And so is this
:)
[Press Ctrl-D]
% Committing transaction
% Transaction successfully committed
```
